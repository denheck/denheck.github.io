Functors are an abstract concept found in mathematics and programming which can be defined as a mapping. In the context of programming, this is often a mapping between concrete structures like objects, types, arrays, etc. In the same context a functor can be loosely described as a "Mappable" interface with added constraints or laws to ensure proper composability.

Here is a contrived example of an Integer object along with a map function defined in JavaScript to almost meet the specification for functor:

{% highlight javascript %}

const Integer = (value) => ({
  map: (fn) => Integer(fn(value))
});

Integer(1).map((i) => i + 1);
// => { value: 2 }

{% endhighlight %}

To make the Integer object a functor it must also obey the following laws:

1. The first of the functor laws involves identity. That is the structure must have a way to map back to itself. More formally, we need to assert that: `obj.map(i => i)` is equivalent to `obj`. In order to correctly assert this in JavaScript I will also include an updated definition of Integer to have a way to extract the provided number so it's equality can be confirmed.

{% highlight javascript %}

const Integer = (value) => ({
  map: (fn) => Integer(fn(value)),
  extract: (value) => value
});
const One = Integer(1);

One.map(i => i).extract() === One.extract();
// => true

{% endhighlight %}

> ### Sidenote on Equivalence
> In the context of the functor laws over the JavaScript Integer object, equivalence is defined as containing the same numeric value. This allows us to assert that multiple `Integer(1)` objects can be swapped out for one another in a program.

2. For the next functor law we must assert that composing 2 functions and passing them to `map` is identical to mapping over those same functions one after the other. Formally: `obj.map(i => f(g(i)))` is equivalent to `obj.map(f).map(g)`. For this I will increment the integer twice using both strategies and assert both structures contain 3 as the value.

{% highlight javascript %}

const Integer = (value) => ({
  map: (fn) => Integer(fn(value)),
  extract: (value) => value
});
const One = Integer(1);
const increment = (i) => i + 1;

One.map(i => increment(increment(i))).extract() === One.map(increment).map(increment).extract();
// => true

{% endhighlight %}

In summary, functors are a structure which can be mapped to another structure as long as it obeys the identity and composition laws defined above. These structures are found throughout programming and one of the most commonly used abstractions for composing applications.
