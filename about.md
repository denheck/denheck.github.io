I started this blog to solidify my understanding of complex programming concepts and to help me retain information I don't use on a daily basis. It is sort of like my own version of Stack Overflow mixed with a random journal of my thoughts and reviews of other people's thoughts. If you find this place, I hope you enjoy it.
