When I told my wife what I was going to name my blog she didn't think people would get it. "My audience will", I told her. I explained how sometimes making decisions when building software often feels more like the "least bad" option rather than the "best". I feel like much of that is influenced by the necessity of thinking pessimistically about the code I write. Always having to think about the many different ways a particular a line could go wrong and the negative ramifications that could come of it.
